# Predicting-stock-prices-using-ML
A beginner-level Python and Machine Learning application focused on building a linear regression model to analyze and predict future stock prices.

- Used the Quandl package to read Stock Data,
- Built a Linear Regression model with sklearn,
- Created training and testing datasets, standardized the input data, fitted the data with the built model, and
- Visualized the predicted stock prices with MatPlotLib.
